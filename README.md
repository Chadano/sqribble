# Sqribble

- https://sqribble.glitch.me

Sqribble is an open-source chatting application created for fun by MrBeeBenson. It is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Use case?
Honestly, I'm not too sure myself. I wrote this during my lunch break because I was bored. I'll continue to maintain it in the foreseeable future whenever I feel like it.

## Can I use the source code?
Yes. Sqribble was made for fun and is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0. 

Have fun :)
